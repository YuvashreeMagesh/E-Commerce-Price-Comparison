# E-commerce Price Comparison and Predictor Tool

## Overview
I spearheaded the development of an e-commerce price comparison and predictor tool utilizing BeautifulSoup, a Python library for web scraping. This tool aggregates data from Poorvika, Flipkart, and Amazon websites and presents it in a user-friendly format, allowing users to compare prices across platforms and predict the minimum price for a given product. By integrating data from multiple sources and leveraging DataFrame functionalities, this tool enhances user decision-making in online shopping experiences.
